# Player Trading

Trade items safely with other players using the trading GUI. No more dropping items on the ground and hoping for the best!

---

## How to Trade

1. Use `/trade <player>` to send a trade request
2. The other player accepts the request
3. Both players add items to the trading window
4. Both players confirm the trade
5. Items are exchanged safely

{% hint style="success" %}
The trading GUI prevents scams by requiring both players to confirm before any items change hands.
{% endhint %}

## Trade Commands

## Using the Trade Window

When a trade is active:

1. **Add items** — Click items in your inventory to add them to the trade
2. **Review** — See what the other player is offering
3. **Confirm** — Click the confirm button when you're happy with the trade
4. **Complete** — Trade executes when both players confirm

{% hint style="warning" %}
If either player changes their offered items after confirming, both confirmations reset. This prevents last-second switcheroos!
{% endhint %}
