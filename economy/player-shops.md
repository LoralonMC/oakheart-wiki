# Player Shops

Create your own shop to trade items with other players! Set up any trade you want — sell items for emeralds, trade diamonds for totems, or create any exchange you can imagine.

## How It Works

Your shop can trade any items for any other items. Sell for emeralds, barter item-for-item, or get creative with your trades. It's your shop!

Physical shops encourage community interaction and give players a reason to explore each other's builds!

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Rank 2+** (5 votes) to create shops
- A **chest** to store your shop's inventory
- A **Shopkeeper Spawn Egg** (purchased at spawn)
- A claimed area for your shop location

### Step 1: Buy a Shopkeeper Spawn Egg

Visit **Quillfeather the Scribe** at spawn to purchase a Shopkeeper Spawn Egg for **100 emeralds**.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Good news!** If you delete your shop later, you get the spawn egg back. This lets you move or reorganize your shops without losing your investment.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Set Up Your Shop

1. Place a **chest** where you want your shop's inventory stored
2. Hold the **Shopkeeper Spawn Egg**
3. **Right-click the chest** to link it as your shop's container
4. **Right-click another block** nearby to place your shopkeeper NPC

### Step 3: Configure Your Trades

1. **Sneak + right-click** your shopkeeper to open the editor
2. Place items from your inventory into the trade slots
3. Set what you're selling and what you want in return
4. You can set up 9 trades per shop

### Step 4: Advertise Your Shop

Set a player warp so customers can find you:
1. Stand at your shop entrance
2. Use `/warp set <name>`
3. Choose the **Shops** category
4. Add a description of what you sell

## Shop Limits by Rank

Your maximum number of shops increases as you rank up:

| Rank | Shops |
|------|-------|
| 1 (Acorn) | 0 |
| 2 (Sprout) | 2 |
| 3-10 | Matches rank (3-10) |
| 11 | 12 |
| 12 | 14 |
| 13 | 16 |
| 14 | 18 |
| 15 | 20 |
| 16 | 22 |
| 17 | 24 |
| 18 | 26 |
| 19 | 28 |
| 20 (Yggdrasil) | 30 |

**Store Ranks** match their equivalent vote rank (Hedgehog = 5 shops, Owl = 30 shops).

## Managing Your Shop

### Restocking

Your shopkeeper sells items directly from the linked chest. Keep it stocked!

- Items in the chest are available for sale
- When the chest is empty, trades become unavailable
- Consider using hoppers to auto-restock from farms

### Editing Trades

**Sneak + right-click** your shopkeeper to open the editor anytime and:
- Add new trades
- Remove existing trades
- Adjust prices

### Moving Your Shopkeeper

Open the editor and click the **Move** button, then right-click a new location.

### Removing Your Shopkeeper

Open the editor and click the **Delete** button to remove your shopkeeper entirely. **You'll get your spawn egg back** to use for another shop or trade to other players.

## Shop Tips

### Pricing Ideas

- **For emeralds:** Check spawn shop prices as a baseline, then price competitively
- **Item trades:** Consider rarity and effort to obtain both items
- **Bulk discounts:** Offer better rates for larger quantities

### Popular Shop Types

- **Building materials** — Bulk stone, wood, concrete
- **Farm produce** — Food, crops, animal products
- **Mob drops** — Gunpowder, string, bones, rare drops
- **Enchanted gear** — Books, tools, armor
- **Specialty items** — Ocean items, nether materials, end resources

### Best Practices

1. **Stock consistently** — Empty shops lose customers
2. **Clear signage** — Let visitors know what you sell at a glance
3. **Fair prices** — Build a good reputation
4. **Nice builds** — An attractive shop draws more visitors
5. **Update your warp** — Keep your description accurate
