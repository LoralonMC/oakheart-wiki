## Tips for Maximizing Income

1. **Diversify** — Don't focus on one shop. Spread your farming across all 5.
2. **Prioritize high-value trades** — Wither Skulls (30), Hearts of the Sea (50), and Netherite Scrap (15) are worth the effort.
3. **Build farms** — Automated farms for crops, mob drops, and fish make daily selling easy.
4. **Check limits** — Plan your farming around what you can actually sell each day.
5. **Raid once daily** — Raids give 25-35 emeralds worth of totems and other drops.
