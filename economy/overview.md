# Economy Overview

Oakheart uses an **emerald-based economy** with carefully controlled currency flow. Emeralds enter the economy through spawn shops and exit through various sinks, creating a balanced trading environment.

## Currency

| Currency | Source | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Emeralds** | Sell items at spawn shops | Primary trading currency |
| **Vote Tokens** | Voting (1 per vote site) | Trade with Merchant Bramblewood |
| **Crate Crystals** | Crates (rare drop) | Trade with Crystalkeeper Shimmervale |

## Earning Emeralds

### Spawn Shops

The primary way to earn emeralds is by selling items at the **five spawn shops**. Each shop is run by a themed NPC:

| Shop | NPC | What They Buy |
|------|-----|---------------|
| **Miner** | Stonebeard | Ores, gems, stone, redstone |
| **Lumberjack** | Willowbark | Logs, sticks, apples |
| **Farmer** | Seedsower | Crops, honey, berries |
| **Alchemist** | Moonwhisper | Mob drops, brewing ingredients |
| **Fisherman** | Tidecaller | Fish, ocean treasures |

### Daily Trade Limits

Each shop has **per-player daily limits** to control emerald generation. Limits reset at midnight server time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why limits?** Without them, emeralds would flood the economy. Limits ensure everyone earns at a fair pace and keeps emeralds valuable.
{% endhint %}

## Spending Emeralds (Currency Sinks)

### Player Warps

|--------|------|
| First warp | Free |
| Additional warps | 20 emeralds each |
| Sponsored Slot 1 | 150 emeralds for 7 days |
| Sponsored Slot 2 | 75 emeralds for 3 days |

### Player Shop Creation

Visit **Quillfeather the Scribe** at spawn to purchase Shopkeeper Spawn Eggs:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Shopkeeper Spawn Egg | 100 emeralds |

You need spawn eggs to place your player shops (ranks only give you permission slots). **Deleting a shop refunds the egg**, so you can reorganize without losing emeralds!

### Claim Chunks

Expand your territory by purchasing Claim Chunks from **Quillfeather the Scribe**:

| Purchase | Cost |
|----------|------|
| 1 Claim Chunk | 40 Emerald Blocks (360 emeralds) |
| 2 Claim Chunks | 75 Emerald Blocks (675 emeralds) — *Save 45 emeralds!* |

### Other Sinks

- **Emerald Crate Keys** — Spend emeralds on crate keys
- **Villager Trades** — Regular villagers still accept emeralds (major sink for Mending books, enchants, tools)
- **Player Shops** — Buy from other players

## Why No Villager Emerald Farms?

Oakheart's economy is designed to prevent hyperinflation:

1. **Villagers don't give emeralds** — They only sell items for emeralds
2. **Spawn shops have limits** — You can't farm infinite emeralds
3. **Raid cooldown** — 24-hour cooldown prevents raid emerald farming
4. **Multiple sinks** — Ways to spend emeralds keep them valuable

This means **emeralds are always valuable**—no massive villager halls breaking the economy!

---

## Tips for New Players

1. **Diversify your farming** — Different shops have different limits
2. **Start with what you enjoy** — Mining? Farming? Fishing? All paths work
3. **Don't sell everything** — Keep materials for your own builds
4. **Trade with players** — Sometimes player shops offer better deals
5. **Check limits daily** — Limits reset at midnight, don't miss free income
