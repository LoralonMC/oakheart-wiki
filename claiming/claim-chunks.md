## Using Claim Chunks

Claim Chunk items are physical items in your inventory. **Right-click** the item to permanently add +1 to your claim limit.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once used, Claim Chunks permanently increase your limit. You can't "unuse" them, but you can withdraw unused chunks (see below).
{% endhint %}

---

## Withdrawing Claim Chunks

Have unused claim slots? You can convert them back into physical Claim Chunk items!

1. Stand in your own land
2. Run `/claimchunk`
3. One unused chunk slot becomes a Claim Chunk item

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Minimum 4 chunks** — You can't withdraw below your base 4 chunk limit.
{% endhint %}

This is useful for:
- Trading extra chunks to other players
- Moving chunks between accounts
- Selling chunks you no longer need
