# Vote Ranks

Progress through 20 ranks by voting daily! Each rank unlocks new perks, commands, and rewards.

## How Voting Works

1. Use `/vote` to open the voting menu
2. Vote on all 5 voting sites daily
3. Each vote gives you:
   - **1 Vote Point** (toward your next rank)
   - **1 Vote Token** (trade at Merchant Bramblewood)
   - **1 Vote Key** (open the Vote Crate)

{% hint style="info" %}
Voting on all 5 sites daily = 5 Vote Points per day. Rank 20 requires 1,000 votes, achievable in about 200 days.
{% endhint %}
