# Prestige System

The Prestige System is a **cosmetic endgame progression** for players who have reached Vote Rank 20 (Yggdrasil). It allows dedicated voters to showcase their commitment to Oakheart with prestige stars.

## What is Prestige?

When you prestige:
- Your rank display resets to "Acorn" visually
- You gain a **prestige star** (⭐) before your name
- You **keep ALL perks** (11 homes, 10 warps, 20 shops, all commands)
- You receive generous rewards
- Server-wide celebration announcement

{% hint style="success" %}
**You keep everything!** Prestiging is purely cosmetic. Your 11 homes, 10 warps, 20 shops, and all commands remain yours.
{% endhint %}

---

## Requirements

To prestige, you must:
- Be **Vote Rank 20** (Yggdrasil)
- Have **1000+ total votes**

Use `/prestige` to begin.

## How It Works

### Before Prestige
```
ʏɢɢᴅʀᴀꜱɪʟ PlayerName
```

### After First Prestige
```
⭐ ᴀᴄᴏʀɴ PlayerName
```

### After Multiple Prestiges
```
⭐⭐⭐ ᴏᴀᴋ PlayerName        (Prestige 3, voted 690 times since last prestige)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ʏɢɢᴅʀᴀꜱɪʟ PlayerName  (Prestige 5, reached Rank 20 again)
⭐×10 ʙʀᴀɴᴄʜ PlayerName      (Prestige 10, voted 100 times since last prestige)
```

## Star Display

| Prestige Level | Display |
|----------------|---------|
| Prestige 1 | ⭐ |
| Prestige 2 | ⭐⭐ |
| Prestige 3 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Prestige 4 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Prestige 5 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Prestige 6+ | ⭐×6, ⭐×7, etc. |

After 5 prestiges, stars use multiplier format (⭐×6) to prevent chat clutter.

{% endhint %}

║  Acorn and gain your 5th prestige     ║
║  star!                                ║
║                                       ║
║  You will KEEP all perks:             ║
║  ✓ 11 homes                           ║
║  ✓ 10 warps                           ║

║  ✓ All commands                       ║
║  ✓ Permanent claims                   ║
║                                       ║
║  [✓ Confirm]         [✗ Cancel]       ║
║                                       ║
