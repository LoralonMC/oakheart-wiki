# Ranks Overview

Oakheart features two rank systems: **Vote Ranks** (free, earned through voting) and **Store Ranks** (paid, instant access). Both systems provide the same core perks—store ranks simply provide instant access without the voting grind.

## Quick Comparison

| Type | Ranks | Cost | Time to Max |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Vote Ranks** | 20 (Acorn → Yggdrasil) | Free | ~200 days |
| **Store Ranks** | 4 main + 1 subscription (Ember → Eternal) | $10 - $100+ | Instant |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Can I have both?** Yes! You keep the best of both. If you have Ember store rank and reach VoteRank 15 through voting, you get VoteRank 15 perks plus Ember's exclusive bonuses.

## Vote Ranks

Progress through 20 ranks by voting daily on our 5 voting sites. Each vote earns you:
- **1 Vote Point** — Progress toward your next rank
- **1 Vote Token** — Trade with Merchant Bramblewood
- **1 Vote Key** — Opens the Vote Crate

**Vote 5 times per day = 5 points/tokens/keys daily!**
