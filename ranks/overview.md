# Ranks Overview

Oakheart features two rank systems: **Vote Ranks** (free, earned through voting) and **Store Ranks** (paid, instant access). Both systems provide the same core perks—store ranks simply provide instant access without the voting grind.

## Quick Comparison

| Type | Ranks | Cost | Time to Max |
