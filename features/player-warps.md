## Creating Your First Warp

### Step 1: Choose a Location

Stand exactly where you want players to teleport. Consider:
- Is the landing spot safe?
- Can visitors clearly see what this warp is for?
- Is it within your claimed land?

### Step 2: Create the Warp

```
/warp set <name>
```

Example: `/warp set MyShop`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Your first warp is free!** Additional warps cost 20 emeralds each.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Customize (Optional)

Set a description, icon, and category to help others find your warp.

## Warp Tips

### Naming Your Warp

**Do:**
- Use clear, descriptive names: `IronFarm`, `DiamondShop`, `MyTown`
- Keep it short and memorable
- Use relevant keywords

**Don't:**
- Use misleading names
- Include inappropriate words
- Copy other players' warp names

### Warp Location Best Practices

1. **Safe landing** — No lava, long drops, or hostile mobs at spawn point
2. **Clear signage** — Put signs explaining what visitors can do
3. **Claimed land** — Set warps inside your claims for security
4. **Accessible** — Don't make visitors solve puzzles to leave

### Growing Your Warp's Popularity

1. **Good description** — Explain what visitors will find
2. **Custom icon** — Stand out in the menu
3. **Correct category** — Help the right people find you
4. **Keep it stocked** — If it's a shop, maintain inventory
5. **Ask for ratings** — Good ratings boost visibility

## Warp Etiquette

### As a Warp Owner

- Keep your warp functional and maintained
- Don't create trap warps that harm visitors
- Update or remove warps you no longer maintain
- Respond to questions about your warp

### As a Visitor

- Respect the warp owner's builds
- Don't grief or steal (against server rules!)
- Leave a rating if you enjoyed your visit
- Report problematic warps to staff

## Troubleshooting

**"You've reached your warp limit"**
- You need a higher rank for more warps
- Vote to rank up, or remove unused warps

**"You need 20 emeralds"**
- First warp is free; additional warps cost emeralds
- Sell items at spawn shops to earn emeralds

**"A warp with that name already exists"**
- Choose a different name
- Names must be unique server-wide

**"You can't set warps here"**
- You may be in a restricted area
- Make sure you're in the survival world
