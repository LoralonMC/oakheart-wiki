# Voice Chat

Oakheart supports **Simple Voice Chat**, a proximity-based voice chat mod that lets you talk to nearby players without needing Discord.

---

## Overview

Simple Voice Chat adds spatial audio to Minecraft—the closer you are to someone, the louder and clearer you hear them. It's completely optional and works alongside regular text chat.

---

## Installation

### Required Mod

You need to install Simple Voice Chat on your client to use this feature.

**Download:** [Simple Voice Chat on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)

### Supported Mod Loaders

| Loader | Supported |
|--------|-----------|
| Fabric | Yes |
| Forge | Yes |
| NeoForge | Yes |
| Quilt | Yes |

### Installation Steps

1. Download Simple Voice Chat for your Minecraft version and mod loader
2. Place the `.jar` file in your `mods` folder
3. Launch Minecraft with your mod loader

{% hint style="info" %}
**No mod?** You can still play on Oakheart without the mod—you just won't hear or use voice chat. Text chat works normally.
{% endhint %}

## How It Works

### Proximity Audio

- **Closer = Louder** — Sound fades with distance
- **Default range:** ~48 blocks
- **Directional audio** — Hear which direction someone is speaking from

### Push-to-Talk vs Voice Activation

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Push-to-Talk** | Hold a key to transmit (default: V) |
| **Voice Activation** | Automatically transmits when you speak |

Most players prefer Push-to-Talk for privacy and to avoid background noise.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound?

2. **Check volume settings** — Press `G` and check Voice Chat Volume
3. **Check Minecraft audio** — Make sure master volume is up
4. **Check system audio** — Minecraft might be muted in your volume mixer

### Others Can't Hear You?

1. **Check microphone selection** — Press `G`, go to settings
2. **Check mute status** — You might be muted (press `M`)
3. **Check Push-to-Talk** — Are you holding the key?
4. **Test microphone** — Try in another application

### High Latency / Choppy Audio?

1. **Lower audio quality** — In voice chat settings
2. **Check internet connection** — Voice chat needs stable connection
3. **Close bandwidth-heavy apps** — Streaming, downloads, etc.

## Etiquette

### Do

- **Use Push-to-Talk** — Avoids transmitting background noise
- **Mute when AFK** — Don't broadcast silence or noise
- **Respect others' preference** — Some players prefer text chat
- **Keep it friendly** — Same rules as text chat apply

### Don't

- **Don't spam** — Constant talking can be annoying
- **Don't be loud** — Keep microphone volume reasonable
- **Don't harass** — Voice chat rules match server rules
- **Don't share personal info** — Stay safe online

---

## Privacy

### Who Can Hear You?

Only players within range (~48 blocks by default) can hear your voice.

### Disabling Voice Chat

If you don't want to use voice chat:
- Simply don't install the mod, or
- Deafen yourself in settings (press `G`)

## Tips

1. **Test before important moments** — Make sure your mic works
2. **Adjust range in settings** — Find what works for you
3. **Use groups for adventures** — Stay connected with your party
4. **Combine with Discord** — Voice chat for proximity, Discord for long-range
5. **It's optional** — No pressure to use it if you prefer text
