# Resource World

Resource Worlds are separate dimensions designed for gathering resources without damaging the main survival worlds.

---

## What are Resource Worlds?

Dedicated worlds that **reset periodically**, giving everyone fresh resources to gather. This protects the main survival worlds from being strip-mined while ensuring resources never run out.

### Available Resource Worlds

| World | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Overworld** | Available |
| **Nether** | Available |
| **End** | Coming soon |

---

## How to Access

### Commands

| Command | Destination |
|---------|-------------|
| `/resource` | Overworld Resource World |
| `/rw` | Overworld Resource World |
| `/resourcenether` | Nether Resource World |
| `/rwn` | Nether Resource World |

Each command teleports you to a random location in that Resource World.

### Returning

```
/spawn
```

Returns you to Oakheart village. You can also use `/home` if you have homes set in the survival world.

## Key Features

### Periodic Resets

Resource Worlds reset on a regular schedule (check announcements for timing). When they reset:

- All blocks regenerate to a fresh world
- Any builds or items left behind are deleted
- New terrain generates with full resources

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never build a base in Resource Worlds!** They will be deleted on reset. Use the main survival worlds for permanent builds.
{% endhint %}

### No Claiming

You cannot claim land in Resource Worlds. This means:

- Anyone can mine anywhere
- Blocks you place aren't protected
- Don't leave valuables behind

### Full Resource Access

Resource Worlds have everything the main worlds have:
- All ore types at normal generation rates
- All biomes and structures
- Normal mob spawning

## Best Practices

### Do

- **Strip mine freely** — That's what it's for!
- **Gather in bulk** — Stock up before resets
- **Use efficiency** — Get the most before reset
- **Return home before reset** — Don't lose your inventory

### Don't

- **Don't build bases** — They'll be deleted
- **Don't store items** — No chests survive reset
- **Don't claim land** — Not possible anyway
- **Don't forget your inventory** — Take everything with you

## Reset Schedule

{% hint style="info" %}
Check server announcements or Discord for the current reset schedule. Resets are typically announced in advance.
{% endhint %}

### Before Reset

A warning is usually broadcast before worlds reset. When you see it:

1. Finish what you're doing
2. Collect any dropped items
3. Return to spawn or your home
4. Don't enter Resource Worlds until reset completes

| **Resets** | Periodically | Never |

| **Homes** | Not recommended | Set them here |

## Tips

1. **Bulk gather before resets** — Maximize your haul
2. **Bring shulker boxes** — Carry more back
3. **Watch for announcements** — Don't get caught in a reset
4. **Use Resource Worlds for ugly mining** — Keep main worlds pretty
5. **Nether Resource World for Ancient Debris** — Don't blow up your main Nether
