# Building Tools

Oakheart has two custom building tools designed for survival mode: the **File** and the **Trowel**. Both are craftable and work with your claims.

## File

A precision tool for editing block states without breaking and replacing blocks.

### What It Does

Right-click supported blocks to modify their appearance:

| Block Type | What You Can Change |
|------------|---------------------|
| Fences, Glass Panes, Iron Bars | Toggle individual connections |
| Walls | Adjust heights and connections |
| Stairs | Change shape (Shift + right-click for top/bottom) |
| Logs & Pillars | Cycle X/Y/Z axis orientations |
| Slabs | Toggle top/bottom placement |
| Directional Blocks | Change facing (observers, pistons, dispensers, droppers) |

### How to Craft

```
[ ] [ ] [I]
[ ] [I] [ ]
[S] [ ] [ ]
```

I = Iron Ingot, S = Stick (diagonal pattern)

### Tips

- Uses durability per edit
- Supports Mending and Unbreaking enchantments
- Repair with iron ingots in an anvil
- Works with your claimed land

## Trowel

A smart building tool that randomly places blocks from your inventory — perfect for natural-looking paths, walls, and floors.

### What It Does

1. Fill an inventory row with different block types (e.g., stone, cobblestone, andesite)
2. **Shift + right-click** to select which row to pull from (Hotbar, Row 1, 2, or 3)
3. **Right-click** to place a random block from that row

Each placement consumes one block from your inventory.

### How to Craft

```
[ ] [ ] [I]
[ ] [I] [I]
[S] [ ] [ ]
```

I = Iron Ingot, S = Stick (like the File but with an extra iron)

### Tips

- Great for paths, floors, and natural-looking builds
- Automatically skips incompatible items (doors, beds, signs)
- Uses durability per placement
- Supports Mending and Unbreaking enchantments
- Repair with iron ingots in an anvil
