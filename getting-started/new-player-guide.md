# New Player Guide

Welcome to Oakheart! This guide will walk you through your first moments on the server and help you get established in the survival world.

---

## Your First Minutes

### Spawning at the Oak Tree

When you join Oakheart, you'll appear at the base of a massive oak tree in the center of our medieval village. This is Oakheart's heart—the central hub where all adventures begin.

**Elder Oakworth**, the village elder, will greet you and offer an optional tutorial. We recommend accepting it if you're new—it takes only 2-3 minutes and rewards you with starter items!

### The Tutorial

If you accept Elder Oakworth's tutorial, you'll:

1. **Take a quick village tour** — See the shops, crates area, and key locations
2. **Learn about the economy** — Sell wheat at the Farmer's shop for your first emeralds
3. **Discover the Ancient Stone Circle** — Learn how to reach the survival world
4. **Get introduced to voting** — Support the server and earn daily rewards

**Tutorial Rewards:**
- 6 Emeralds
- 1 Vote Key
- Tutorial Book (handy command reference)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Skipped the tutorial?** Run `/tutorial` anytime to restart it, or pick up a Tutorial Book from Elder Oakworth.
{% endhint %}

## Getting to the Survival World

The **Ancient Stone Circle** near spawn is your gateway to the wilderness. You have two options:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Portal | Right-click the Ancient Stone Circle |
| Command | Type `/wild` or `/rtp` |

This teleports you to a random location in the survival world where you can start building.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Tip:** Once you find a spot you like, immediately claim it and set a home so you can return!
{% endhint %}

## Protecting Your Build

### Creating a Land Claim

Oakheart uses a chunk-based claiming system. To protect your builds:

1. **Stand where you want to build**
2. **Create your land:** `/lands create <name>`
   *Example:* `/lands create MyBase`
3. **Claim the chunk:** `/lands claim`
4. **View your claim:** `/lands view`

### Claim Limits

| Source | Chunks |
|--------|--------|
| Starting amount | 4 chunks |
| First 4 hours of playtime | +1 chunk per hour |
| **Total free chunks** | **8 chunks** |

You can earn more chunks through voting, crates, ranks, and events.

{% hint style="success" %}
**What's protected?**
Within your claim, only you and trusted players can build, break blocks, open containers, or harm your animals.
{% endhint %}

## Setting Homes

Homes let you quickly teleport back to your favorite locations.

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sethome <name>` | Save your current location |
| `/home <name>` | Teleport to a saved home |
| `/homes` | Open the homes GUI menu |
| `/removehome <name>` | Delete a home |

### Home Limits

You start with **1 home** at the default rank (Acorn). As you rank up through voting or purchasing store ranks, you unlock more:

- **Rank 1 (Acorn):** 1 home
- **Rank 10 (Root):** 6 homes
- **Rank 20 (Yggdrasil):** 11 homes

## The Economy

### Earning Emeralds

Emeralds are Oakheart's currency. The primary way to earn them is by selling items at spawn shops:

| Shop | What to Sell |
|------|-------------|
| **Miner (Stonebeard)** | Ores, gems, stone, redstone |
| **Lumberjack (Willowbark)** | Logs, sticks, apples |
| **Farmer (Seedsower)** | Crops, honey, berries |
| **Alchemist (Moonwhisper)** | Mob drops, brewing materials |
| **Fisherman (Tidecaller)** | Fish, ocean treasures |

Each shop has **daily trade limits** per player—this keeps the economy balanced. Limits reset daily.

### Spending Emeralds

- **Set player warps** (20 emeralds per warp after the first)
- **Rent sponsored warp slots** (premium visibility)
- **Buy Emerald Crate keys** (coming soon)
- **Trade with players** for items

---

## Voting

Voting supports the server and earns you rewards!

### How to Vote

1. Run `/vote` to open the voting GUI
2. Click each of the 5 voting sites
3. Vote on each site (takes ~2 minutes total)

### Vote Rewards (Per Site)

- **1 Vote Token** — Trade with Merchant Bramblewood
- **1 Vote Key** — Opens the Vote Crate
- **1 Vote Point** — Progress toward vote ranks

Vote daily on all 5 sites = **5 keys, 5 tokens, 5 points per day!**

## Helpful Tips

### Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Claim your builds immediately
- Explore spawn to learn the layout
- Ask questions in chat—we're friendly!
- Vote daily for free rewards
- Trade safely with `/trade <player>`

**DON'T:**
- Build near others without asking (64+ blocks distance)
- Destroy unclaimed builds (still against rules!)
- Use hacked clients or exploits
- Share personal information

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to claim** — Builds outside claims can be griefed
2. **Getting lost** — Set a home as soon as you find a spot!
3. **Selling everything** — Keep materials for your own projects
4. **Ignoring voting** — Free rewards add up fast over time
