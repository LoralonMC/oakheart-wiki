# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers for Oakheart players.

---

## Getting Started

**Q: How do I protect my build?**

Use `/lands create <name>` to create a land, then `/lands claim` to claim the chunk you're standing in. Use `/lands view` to see chunk borders.

**Q: How many chunks can I claim?**

You start with 4 chunks and earn +1 per hour for your first 4 hours = 8 free chunks total. Get more via voting, crates, or the store.

**Q: What's the server currency?**

Emeralds. Earn them by selling items at the 5 spawn shops (Miner, Farmer, Lumberjack, Alchemist, Fisherman).

---

## Economy

**Q: Why can't I sell more items at spawn shops?**

Spawn shops have per-player daily limits to balance the economy. Limits reset every 24 hours.

**Q: How do I create a player shop?**

Buy a Shopkeeper Spawn Egg from Quillfeather the Scribe at spawn (100 emeralds, requires Rank 2+). Place a chest, then use the egg to create your shop NPC. Set a warp with `/warp set` so customers can find you!

**Q: How do I trade safely with other players?**

Use `/trade <player>` for a secure trading GUI.

---

## Ranks & Progression

**Q: How do I rank up?**

Vote on all 5 voting sites daily (`/vote`). Each vote gives 1 Vote Point toward your next rank.

**Q: How long to reach max rank?**

Rank 20 (Yggdrasil) requires 1,000 votes = ~200 days of consistent voting.

**Q: What do ranks give me?**

More homes, warps, shop slots, claim chunks, and utility commands. See [Rank Perks](../ranks/perks.md).

**Q: What are Store Ranks?**

Paid ranks ($10-$100) that give instant access to vote rank perks plus exclusives like Keep Inventory.

---

## Claims & Land

**Q: Can someone grief my unclaimed build?**

Griefing is against rules even for unclaimed builds, but you should always claim to be safe!

**Q: Do claims extend underground?**

Yes, claims protect from bedrock to sky limit (full vertical chunk).

**Q: What happens if I run out of claim chunks?**

You can't claim more until you get Claim Chunk items from voting, crates, or trading.

**Q: Can I withdraw claim chunks I've added?**

Yes! Use `/claimchunk` while standing in your land to withdraw an unused chunk back into a physical item (minimum 4 chunks must remain).

---

## Gameplay

**Q: Is PvP enabled?**

PvP is opt-in only. Use `/pvp` to toggle it. Both players must have PvP enabled for combat.

**Q: Can mobs spawn in my claim?**

Yes, claims don't affect mob spawning. Use torches/lighting to prevent spawns.

**Q: What mods are allowed?**

Optifine/Sodium, Litematica (no printer), minimaps (no entity radar/caves), shaders, inventory sorting, and Simple Voice Chat.

---

## Voting & Rewards

**Q: What do I get for voting?**

Per vote: 1 Vote Token, 1 Vote Key, 1 Vote Point. That's 5 of each daily!

**Q: What are Vote Tokens for?**

Trade them at Merchant Bramblewood (spawn marketplace) for claim chunks, smith materials, and more.

**Q: What are Crate Crystals?**

A pity system currency from crates. Trade at Crystalkeeper Shimmervale for guaranteed rewards.
