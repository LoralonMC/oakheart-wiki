# Emerald Crate

The Emerald Crate is an in-game economy sink, allowing players to spend their hard-earned emeralds on crate rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Coming Soon!** The Emerald Crate is currently being designed. Check back later or watch for announcements on Discord.
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

The Emerald Crate serves as a major **economy sink** to help control inflation. Instead of emeralds piling up endlessly, players can gamble them for valuable rewards.

---

## How It Will Work

- Purchase keys with emeralds at spawn
- Open at the Crates Pavilion
- Rewards will include items you can't easily buy elsewhere
