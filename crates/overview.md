## Emerald Crate

**Purpose:** Major economy sink to control emerald inflation.

- Buy keys with emeralds
- Contains valuable rewards worth the investment
- Helps maintain healthy server economy

---

## Seasonal Crate

**Limited-time crates** available during special events:
- Holiday events (Winter, Halloween, etc.)
- Server anniversaries
- Special celebrations

Seasonal crates contain **exclusive items** only available during that event.

---

## Tips

1. **Vote every day** — 5 keys daily adds up fast
2. **Save crystals for exclusives** — Trade them at the Crystal Trader
3. **Check seasonal crates** — Limited-time exclusives don't return
4. **Open crates in bulk** — More satisfying and efficient
