## What is Oakheart?

Oakheart is a community-focused Minecraft survival server where players build, trade, and adventure together in a cozy medieval village atmosphere. Our server emphasizes player interaction, physical shops, and collaborative gameplay.

When you join, you'll spawn at the great central oak tree in the heart of Oakheart village—a magical clearing nestled within a dense oak forest. From here, venture through the Ancient Stone Circle into the survival world to begin your journey.
