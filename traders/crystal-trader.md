## Crystal Acquisition Timeline

**Vote Crate only (no paid crates):**

| Crystals | Estimated Time | Can Afford |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| 30 | ~2-3 months | Cottage Hat |
| 60 | ~4-6 months | Mending Book |
| 130 | ~10-12 months | Full Cottage Set |

**With Paid Crates:**
- Much faster crystal acquisition
- Higher drop rates in paid crates
- Mix both for best results

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Long-term goal:** Exclusive cosmetics are designed as dedication rewards. Don't expect to get the full Cottage Set quickly from voting alone!
{% endhint %}

## Spending Strategies

### Pity-Focused (Practical)

If you want guaranteed valuable items:
1. Save 60 crystals for **Mending Book**
2. Save 70 crystals for **Ancient Debris**
3. Use remaining for claim chunks

### Cosmetic-Focused (Collector)

If you want the exclusive items:
1. Save everything for the **Cottage Set** (130 crystals)
2. Then work on Gardener's Hoe and Forester's Axe
3. Grab decoratives last

### Escalation-Focused (Gambler)

If you love opening crates:
1. Trade crystals for higher-tier keys
2. More crate openings = more crystal drops
3. Cycle continues!

## Tips

1. **Crystals are rare** — Don't spend impulsively
2. **Plan big purchases** — Full Cottage Set takes dedication
3. **Pity rewards are guaranteed** — Better than gambling for Mending
4. **Cosmetics are exclusive** — Only available here
5. **No weekly limits** — Save as long as you want
