## What Are Hardened Ingots?

Hardened Ingots are crafting materials made from massive amounts of blocks and rare resources. They bridge the gap between Reforged gear and the ultimate Hardened tier.

**Three Types:**
- **Hardened Netherite Ingot** — Compressed netherite and ancient debris alloy
- **Hardened Gold Ingot** — Gold infused with Heart of the Sea
- **Hardened Copper Ingot** — Diamond-reinforced copper alloy

## Tips

1. **Plan ahead** — Calculate total ingots needed before gathering materials
2. **Hearts of the Sea** — Hardest material to farm; treasure hunting required
3. **Copper blocks** — Easiest to mass produce; smelt and craft in bulk
4. **Netherite blocks** — Most expensive; requires 9 ingots each
