# Smith System Overview

Oakheart features a custom gear progression system that extends beyond vanilla Netherite. Visit **Hammerhand the Smith** at spawn to upgrade your equipment into powerful Reforged and ultimate Hardened gear.

---

## The Progression Path

```
[ Netherite Gear ]
       ↓
[ Reforged Gear ]    ← Better enchantments, Mending, Unbreaking IV
       ↓
[ Hardened Gear ]    ← Maximum enchantments, Unbreakable (never breaks!)
```

**All upgrades happen through Hammerhand the Smith**, a gruff dwarf-like NPC at spawn. He offers three shop interfaces:

1. **Reforged Gear** — Upgrade Netherite equipment with rare materials
2. **Hardened Ingots** — Craft special alloy materials
3. **Hardened Gear** — Ultimate unbreakable equipment (requires Reforged)

---

## Tier Comparison

| Tier | Enchantment Level | Durability | Example |
|------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| **Vanilla Netherite** | Up to V | Repairable | Sharpness V |
| **Reforged** | Level VI | Mending + Unbreaking IV | Sharpness VI |
| **Hardened** | Level VIII | **Unbreakable** | Sharpness VIII |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Hardened gear never breaks!** It has the built-in Unbreakable property—no Mending needed because it never takes durability damage.
{% endhint %}

Efficiency VIII + Haste II beacon = **instant deepslate mining**

This specific breakpoint makes Hardened tools feel truly endgame. Regular mining becomes effortless.
